# BeverageStoreDatabase
Paul Macfarlane

A SQL database that stores information about beverage stores. See image of schema for schema.  

Run createStatements.sql to create tables.  

Run inserts.sql to insert data into tables. Some will fail intentionally to test constraints.

Modules.sql holds a few functions, a procedure, and a few triggers.
